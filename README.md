# Learning-Hugging-Face-models

A hands-on collection of experiments and code samples for working with **Hugging Face models** — built by **Krish Kumar**.

---

## 📘 About

This repository is dedicated to understanding and experimenting with models from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) ecosystem.  
It covers key aspects such as:

- Loading and running **pre-trained transformer models**
- Fine-tuning models on **custom datasets**
- Exploring **tokenizers**, **pipelines**, and **inference**
- Logging results and managing **experiment outputs**

The goal is to build practical intuition for how large language models (LLMs) function and how they can be applied to NLP tasks.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krisjscott/Learning-Hugging-Face-models.git
cd Learning-Hugging-Face-models
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you don’t have a `requirements.txt` yet, you can create one with:
>
> ```
> transformers
> torch
> datasets
> ```

### 3. Run the example

```bash

## 💡 Key Learning Goals

* Understand transformer architectures and pre-training concepts
* Experiment with Hugging Face’s `pipeline` API
* Perform inference, evaluation, and fine-tuning on different NLP tasks
* Explore optimization and deployment workflows for model use

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add a `notebooks/` directory with Jupyter notebooks for exploration
* Implement custom datasets and fine-tuning examples
* Integrate with FastAPI or Gradio for live inference demos
* Add hardware benchmarking (CPU vs GPU) results
* Document experiment configurations and results
